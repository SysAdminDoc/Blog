# The Latest Browser Wars: A Rundown (March 25, 2025)

The browser landscape is heating up, driven by privacy, extensions, and corporate agendas. Here’s the scoop on Google, Firefox, Brave, and the buzz around Ladybird.

## A Snapshot
Chrome dominates with 60%+ market share, Firefox holds a loyal 3-4%, Brave gains among privacy buffs, and newbies like Ladybird stir curiosity. The fight? Ad blockers, privacy, and trust.

## Google and uBlock Origin: Why the Rage?
Google’s phasing out Manifest V2 extensions in Chrome for Manifest V3, citing security and performance. This kills powerful ad blockers like uBlock Origin (30M+ users). As of early 2025, Chrome’s disabling uBlock Origin, flagging it as “unsupported” since it uses V2’s `blockingWebRequest` API—replaced by V3’s weaker `declarativeNetRequest`.

Users are mad because uBlock Origin blocks ads, trackers, and malware, Google’s V3-friendly uBlock Lite is a downgrade (per its dev, Raymond Hill). With 85%+ of extensions V3-ready, critics see this as Google (an ad giant) prioritizing revenue over user control. Chrome’s becoming a walled garden where ads rule.

## Firefox: What’s the Beef?
Firefox, on Gecko, isn’t bound by Google’s V3 rules. Mozilla supports both V2 and V3, keeping uBlock Origin alive. So why the anger? Old grudges (bloat, Pocket) mix with new fears, a 2024 privacy policy update sparked data collection panic, though Mozilla says it doesn’t harvest content. Plus, its tiny share and occasional compatibility issues fuel “sinking ship” vibes despite privacy cred.

## Brave: Hero with a Dark Side?
Brave (Chromium-based) offers built-in ad blocking and pledges uBlock Origin support “as long as feasible,” dodging Google’s clampdown. But its opt-in crypto (BAT) feels sketchy to some, and a 2020 scandal (injecting affiliate links) hurt trust. As a Chromium fork, it might eventually bow to V3 pressure. Great for ad-free browsing for now, but the baggage lingers.

## Ladybird: The New Kid
Ladybird’s an open-source browser from Andreas Kling, originally tied to SerenityOS, now standalone. It’s not Chromium, Gecko, or WebKit, it’s a fresh engine for modern web standards, free of legacy cruft. As of March 2025, it’s pre-alpha, not daily-driver-ready, but excites those craving independence from Big Tech. No release date or extension plans yet, but it’s one to watch.

## The Big Picture
- **Google**: uBlock Origin’s demise feels like an ad-driven betrayal.
- **Firefox**: Policy scares overshadow its ad-blocker loyalty.
- **Brave**: Privacy wins, crypto and history lose.
- **Ladybird**: A hopeful underdog, years from the fight.

The war’s less about speed, more about control. Pick your poison or wait for Ladybird.
